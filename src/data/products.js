      Lensing is available for all the packages with an LED pitch of 1.6mm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way our packages are mounted to the 20x20mm heat spreader PCB allows us to place a collimating lens extremely close to the LED, allowing over 90% of the emitted light before it quickly diverges. Depending on the package being lensed, the light coming from the LED can be reduced from the typical 120 degrees of divergence to angles as small as 40 and 60 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        For systems that require long distance light propagation, this initial lensing stage is an excellent option that helps reduce cost by reducing the size of any additional lenses that need to be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please contact us if your system needs to meet specific light distribution or divergence angles.

        The 3535 line offers excellent thermal dissipation and utilizes high power LEDs inside its packages.  Packages can be purchased mounted to a small copper heat spreader PCB that needs further assembly or may be purchased with the package mounted into a larger heat spreader PCB that contains all the components necessary so that integration in to your system is as easy as a plugging in a connector.  Custom PCB sizes are available upon request.
